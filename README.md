JPEGKrusher is part of my various experiments in procedural image generation and computer-art. A simple app to create glitch-art by introducing arbitrary corruption in the JPEG compression within images.
It functions by altering the binary data of a JPEG encoded file along arbitrary parameters. The controls available have various effects on the corruption within the resulting image.
Of course feel free to fork this project or propose any changes you would like to see.
